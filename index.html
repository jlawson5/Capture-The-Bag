<h2>Capture The Bag</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You know how cats seem to have an unknown, overwhelming love for paper bags and boxes? As a cat, you must secure as many bags as possible from your rival paper-bag-lovers.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players must outmaneuver their opponents to capture the bag as many times as they can before they run out of lives.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This game is a play on Capture The Flag. Instead of two teams trying to get each other's flag, one cat must go against a team of other cats to capture their bag.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Your cat can move left, right, up, and down using the arrow keys. There are three enemy cats. The Tackle Cat, the gray cat on the left, will regularly dash towards you, which will take a life if it hits you. Tackle Cat, however, always travels in a straight line, making it easier to dodge him. Laser Cat (complete with Cyclops' visor from X-Men) will regularly shoot high speed lasers at you, which will also take a life. The lasers also travel in a straight line; however, this paired with Tackle Cat can make things a bit more difficult. Magnet Cat, the final cat, can either be your best friend or your worst nightmare. Magnet Cat will occasionally magnetize you, warping you a short distance towards him. This can be a huge help, warping you out of harms way, or it can indirectly kill you, putting you in the path of Tackle Cat or a laser. Your goal is to pick up the enemy's bag and bring it to your flag to capture it. The goal is to capture as many bags as you can before you run out of lives.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
My goal for this prototype was to start working with simple AI's, and to see what more the Arcade Physics can do. particularly, I used the MoveToXY and MoveToObject functions a lot throughout this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
This prototype has simple AI that actively try to attack the player, and one AI that will either help or indirectly harm the player, depending on the circumstances.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are a cat with an inexplainable love for bags. The three opposing cats are three cats trying to protect their bags.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The only story in this game is that you are a cat with a love for paper bags that is trying to get more bags.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is aimed towards players that like simple action games and a bit of a challenge. This game is also good for anyone who loves cats.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Since there is no winning condition, the game will last as long as the player can survive.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players must pre-plan their route to successfully avoid the enemy cats. If the player has good timing, they can also use Magnet Cat to their advantage, using him to warp out of harms way.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All sprites were made myself. Sound effects are from soundbible.com. Music was made by my brother, Shaun Lawson
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I had no particular game in mind when I made this game, and I do not know what games it is similar to as this is not the kind of game I usually play. I did not use any Phaser example games; however, I did use Phaser's sample programs for Arcade Physics to learn the correct syntax for using some of the functions. I also borrowed some code from my previous two games.
