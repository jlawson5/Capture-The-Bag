<h2>Gravity Man</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Gravity Man must use his ability to control gravity to collect coins!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players must use physics to their advantage to collect the quickly moving coins and achieve a high score.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This game is an endless arcade game. The player is free to collect coins for as long as they want.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Gravity Man can move left and right using the arrow keys. Gravity Man can also reverse the force of gravity at will by pressing the Space Bar. Gravity Man must collect coins that are rapidly bouncing up and down; however, these coins are also affected by Gravity Man's powers, making his powers useful for catching coins in mid-air or even slowing them to a stop. In the future, more levels will be made. As the game progresses obstacles will be introduced to make the gathering of coins more difficult. These obstacles will include floating platforms that the coins will bounce off of, enemies that can deduct points or reset Gravity Man's progress for that level, and objects that will temporarily add gravity in the x-axis. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The primary game mechanic in this game is the ability to flip gravity. I feel that playing with physics is a good way to make interesting and fun gameplay mechanics for platforming and puzzle games.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Though this prototype is simple, and only really shows off the ability to alter the physics of the world, the game will eventually toy with physics in many other ways, such as adding a vertical gravity.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
So far, this is an abstract game with no plot. Gravity Man is a human astronaut that has gained the power to alter gravity.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
So far, this is an abstract game with no plot. In the future, a simple plot may be made for this game, explaining why Gravity Man is collecting all of these coins.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is aimed towards people who like simple games that are easy to pick up and are not stressful. This game is also good for people that like endless games, where you play for high scores.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
1+ minutes, depending on the player.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
To be able to efficiently grab coins, players must use the ability to control gravity to their advantage. Controlling gravity can get Gravity Man in a better position to get a coin or can slow coins to a stop with proper timing.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All sprites were made myself. Sound effects were taken from soundbible.com and are considered public domain. The Phaser example game "Starstruck" was used as a template for much of my code. I also used the example game "Invaders" for reference regarding score and object collisions.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
My game uses "Starstruck" as a template, and shares some similarities and code with it. My game is also heavily influenced by puzzle and platforming games that use physics as a main gameplay mechanic; most notably VVVVVV for the PC, in which players use the gravity control mechanic to traverse danger filled levels to make it to the end of the area.
